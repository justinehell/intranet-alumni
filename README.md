## Description

Here is a [video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7dqhdmYUhA) of the site "The Nuum Factory Intranet"

**Project Context:**

Development of a platform to connect former graduates of The Nuum Factory school.
This project was carried out with the help of a back-end developer (use of the Django REST framework). I was responsible for developing the front-end part with the VueJS framework and Vuetify as a component library.

**The main features developed are as follows:**
- connection management (registration, account activation, password reset),
- display and edit data (search for a student, modification of profile, creation / deletion / modification of professional experiences)
